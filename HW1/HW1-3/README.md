## Write a Python program:
### (a) Suppose A < B < ... < Z, find a binary search tree whose post-order traversal is DBMKSPF.
### (b) To store this BST.
### (c) To take an input letter x, which is one of the 26 letters, so that:
### <pre> if (x is in the tree) </pre>
### <pre>  output the level of x </pre>
### <pre> if (x is not in the tree) </pre>
### <pre>  insert x into the tree and output the level of x </pre>
