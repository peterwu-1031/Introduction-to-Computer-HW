# Binary Search Tree
## Write a Python program:
### (a) Suppose A < B < ... < Z, find a binary search tree whose post-order traversal is DBMKSPF.
### (b) To store this BST.
### (c) To take an input letter x, which is one of the 26 letters, so that:
###     if (x is in the tree)
###       output the level of x (suppose the root is in level 1)
###     if (x is not in the tree)
###       insert x into the tree and output the level of x
## How to run:  python3 main.py [test_case](representing a capital letter)
